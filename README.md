Stars come in all shapes and sizes. In the beginning, a star is usually smaller and bluer. The more massive a star is, the more energy it contains and the higher temperature it has. As stars grow older, they begin to grow in size and turn more yellow. The star 

## The Evolution of Galaxies

  The two main types of galaxies we see in the universe are the more disorganized, spherical elliptical galaxies and the more organized, star forming disk-like galaxies. There is a larger diversity of disk-like galaxies since these galaxies can have differing amounts of arms, or different center shapes like bars.

  Younger galaxies tend to be smaller and disk-like, as the majority of the stars are in adolescence (small and blue). These galaxies often contain many starforming regions, as the stars experience quick lives. When these stars die, they give off many nutrients and elements for new stars. The constant creation and destruction of young, bluer stars means a well-developed galaxy that is disk-like and organized. Over time,
