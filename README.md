  Younger galaxies tend to be smaller and disk-like, as the majority of the stars are in adolescence (small and blue). These galaxies often contain many starforming regions, as the stars experience quick lives. When these stars die, they give off many nutrients and elements for new stars. The constant creation and destruction of young, bluer stars means a well-developed galaxy that is disk-like and organized. Over time,
