## The Evolution of Our Universe
Hello! My name is Matthew Bzowyckyj and I am a freshman at Kingswood OXford School in West Hartford, CT. During the summer of 2018, I worked as a researcher at UCONN to follow my passion in astronomy and astrophysics. This website compiles all that I have learned during the past three months. 


## The Evolution of Stars

  Stars come in many shapes and sizes. An average star life begins with it being smaller and bluer. The more massive a star is, the more energy it contains and the higher temperature it has. As the star becomes older, it begins to grow in size and turn more yellow. The star 
is no longer as massive, and it begins to cool. The older the star becomes, the redder and cooler it becomes. It will also increase in diameter. Eventually, the star will start to run out of energy. When the star beings to create iron, it can no longer sustain itself. The gravity pulling inward towards the star's center becomes greater than the force pushing outward. The gravity will cause the star to collapse, shedding its outer layer. A star usually leaves its small core behind as a red or white dwarf.
  If a star is more massive, it may instead turn into a nuetron star or black hole. A nuetron star is considered the extreme version of a white dwarf. During its supernova, the star pushed everything away except for the nuetrons in its core, leaving a small, dense object with a immensely fast rotation. Nuetron stars are usually created from stars that are more massive than average, but not massive enough to form a black hole.
  If a star is very massive, it will most likely turn into a black hole. When the star explodes, 

## The Evolution of Galaxies

 There are two main categories of galaxies in the universe. Some galaxies are more disorganized and spherical. These galaxies are called elliptical galaxies. Others are more organized, star forming disk-like galaxies. These galaxies are usually spiral or barred spiral.

  Younger galaxies tend to be smaller and disk-like, as the majority of the stars are in adolescence (small and blue). These galaxies often contain many starforming regions, as the stars experience quick lives. When these stars die, they give off many nutrients and elements for new stars. The constant creation and destruction of young, bluer stars means a well-developed galaxy that is disk-like and organized. Over time,
