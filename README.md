## The Evolution of Our Universe
Hello! My name is Matthew Bzowyckyj and I am a freshman at Kingswood OXford School in West Hartford, CT. During the summer of 2018, I worked as a researcher at UCONN to follow my passion in astronomy and astrophysics. This website compiles all that I have learned during the past three months. 


## The Evolution of Stars

Stars come in all shapes and sizes. An average star life begins with it being smaller and bluer. The more massive a star is, the more energy it contains and the higher temperature it has. As the star becomes older, it begins to grow in size and turn more yellow. The star 
is no longer as massive, and it begins to cool. The older the star becomes, the redder and cooler it becomes. It will also increase in diameter. Eventually, the star will start to run out of energy, and once it starts creating iron, the force of gravity pulling inward becomes greater than the star's force repelling outward. This will cause the star to collapse, shedding its outer layer, and leaving the small core behind as a red or white dwarf.

## The Evolution of Galaxies

  The two main types of galaxies we see in the universe are the more disorganized, spherical elliptical galaxies and the more organized, star forming disk-like galaxies. There is a larger diversity of disk-like galaxies since these galaxies can have differing amounts of arms, or different center shapes like bars.

  Younger galaxies tend to be smaller and disk-like, as the majority of the stars are in adolescence (small and blue). These galaxies often contain many starforming regions, as the stars experience quick lives. When these stars die, they give off many nutrients and elements for new stars. The constant creation and destruction of young, bluer stars means a well-developed galaxy that is disk-like and organized. Over time,
